# Interest Rate Swap Contract Design
Developed for FIN330 â€” Derivatives at Tunis Business School.  
This project involved designing and negotiating a **real-world interest rate swap** between BNA Assurances and STB Bank to hedge duration and interest-rate mismatch risk in a Tunisian insurance portfolio.

## Highlights
- **Partnership:** insurance side and financial counterparty (bank).
- **Objective:** Neutralize a negative duration gap (âˆ’0.961) by paying floating and receiving fixed to stabilize exposure against falling rates.  
- **Methodology:**  
  - Calculated asset/liability durations and risk premiums using zero-coupon curves from *Tunisie Clearing*.  
  - Determined notional and swap rate through forward-rate bootstrapping and duration-matching formula.  
  - Conducted real negotiation with **Mr. Ousama Mellouli**, Director of Treasury at STB.  
- **Deliverables:** Full valuation model (Excel), regulatory compliance under **BCT Circular 2021-02**, and signed final swap contract.  
- **Outcome:** A fully structured, IFRS 9â€“compliant swap framework demonstrating interest-rate risk mitigation for non-banking institutions.
